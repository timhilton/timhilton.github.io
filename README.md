# Personal Site

This site was originally just a plain HTML/CSS/JS site which I then converted to a `create react app` site.  That was the best 2015 had to offer, so I figured I should probably update the site to use something more modern.  I've opted to create a `next.js` site for ease of sever side rendering.  I'll be updating features more regularly so be sure to check back if you're interested.  

## Dependencies
- Next.js
- React.js
- SVGR
- Styled-Components

## Tooling
This site is being hosted on Netlify and is utilizing some of their tooling like Form handling.
